# Cinecenta

[Cineceta](http://cinecenta.com) is a movie theatre run by the University of Victoria Student Society.  Its a wonderful place to go see movies without all the noise and distraction of first-run theatres here in Victoria.  And they have great popcorn!

Anyway, their web site is fine, but I wanted a simple means of seeing what is showing tonight.

I also wanted to experiment with local notifications so this app displays a notification each morning of what is playing in the evening.

The app also offers a Today widget showing what's playing today on the lock screen:

Since this app displays content from the Cineceta web site without their express permission, I doubt it would be accepted into the App Store.  If you want it on your iPhone, you'll have to compile it yourself using Xcode and side-load it onto your phone.
