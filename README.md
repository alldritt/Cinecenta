# Cinecenta

Cineceta is a movie theatre run by the Unicersity of Victorual Student Society.  Its a wonderful place to go see movies without all the noise and distraction of first-run theters here in Victoria.  And they have great popcorn!

Anyway, their web site is fine, but I wanted a simple means of seeing what is showing tonight.

The app supports dynamic type using a standard UITableViewCell.

I also wanted to experiment with local notifications so this app also displays a notification each morning of what is playing in the evening.

This app is a bit of a test bed for various iOS experiments.
